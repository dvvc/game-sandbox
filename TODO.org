#+TODO: TODO FIXME IDEA CURRENT | DONE FIXED CANCELLED

* Version 1
** DONE Load game in an existing canvas by ID
** DONE Game loop, separate state
** DONE Load game library as an external module
** DONE Detect game code changes, trigger reload
** DONE Support keyboard input
** DONE How to handle multiple game files that change?
** DONE Add a linter
** DONE Publish to npm
** DONE Add code documentation, clean up
** FIXED Error resolving relative directories when executing ./node_modules/.bin/game-sandbox
** FIXED The out.js bundle is created inside node_modules (should be configurable?)
   --- But how to serve it then?
** FIXED dynamic import issue?
   node_modules/game-sandbox/lib/index.js: warning: This dynamic import will not be bundled because the argument
   is not a string literal (surround with a try/catch to silence this warning)
** DONE Decouple ~baseDir~ and ~watchDir~ (??)
** DONE Register with the 'load' event inside ~runGame~
** TODO Detect changes to initial state and do a full reload
** TODO Record / loop state / go back
** TODO Implement the ~init~ cli function
** TODO Write documentation on how to use the library
   - Is it a requirement to use ESM? Since the dist bundle uses it?
   - Document directory structure: baseDir / watchDir / outputDir
   - Copying game-sandbox.js (in the future, serve it automagically)
   - Document the user-facing functions and data structures (env, draw, setup, state)
** TODO Try / document game-sandbox in Glitch
** TODO Handle esbuild errors gracefully (e.g. notify client?)
** TODO When there's an error, the client should not keep going. Also, how to recover?
** TODO Game tools (blit image, etc)
** FIXME Can we be loading stale ~out.js~ from a previously existing dist??
** TODO The ~runGame~ moduleUrl parameter is confusing
** FIXME Detect clashes with made up ~build~ url if the base dir has a ~build~ subdirectory


* Version 2
** TODO Use WebGL
** TODO Serve the actual game-sandbox.js (rather than having to copy it manually)
** TODO Support gamepad input
